Invoke the `flow:continue-issue` skill using the Skill tool and follow it exactly as presented to you.

**If the user provided arguments** (e.g., `/flow:continue elf.3` or `/flow:continue --all`), pass them to the skill.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT run any commands (bd sync, bd list, bd show, etc.) BEFORE invoking the skill. The skill will tell you exactly what commands to run and in what order.
