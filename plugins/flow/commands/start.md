description: Start working on a beads task (task selection, branch management, context display)
---

**YOUR ONLY TASK RIGHT NOW:**
1. Call `Skill` tool with `flow:start`
2. Say: "Skill invoked. Waiting for skill content."
3. END YOUR RESPONSE

That's it. Nothing else. Do not run any commands. Do not show tasks. Do not call bd.

---

**VIOLATION CHECK - Did you do ANY of these?**
- ❌ Run `bd ready`
- ❌ Run `bd graph`
- ❌ Run `bd list`
- ❌ Run any git command
- ❌ Show a task list
- ❌ Continue past "Waiting for skill content"

**If yes: You violated the process. Stop everything.**

---

**What happens next:**
The skill content will appear in the next message. It starts with "# Flow: Start Task".
ONLY THEN do you follow the skill instructions.
