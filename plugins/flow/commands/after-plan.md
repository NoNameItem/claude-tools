**YOUR ONLY TASK RIGHT NOW:**
1. Call `Skill` tool with `flow:after-plan`
2. Say: "Skill invoked. Waiting for skill content."
3. END YOUR RESPONSE

That's it. Nothing else. Do not run any commands.

**What happens next:**
The skill content will appear in the next message. ONLY THEN do you follow it.
